### Introdction
The problem donate-pie solves
Donation to covid relief projects is not transparent and less impacting ,we are trying to solve this using blockchain.Using matic network,wyre payment users can donate directly using USD to crypto relief projects.Any crypto relief ptojects can create its own fund on blockchain as DAO.

When people donate you can issue them slices which represent their share in your project.

they can vote with their share on proposals to use donated funds or giving stake to more donors

any covid-19 relief project can create it's own Slice DAO and manage donated funds transperently using a DAO governance.

check video demo and image demo for more information or test the demo on hosted surge website.

### Challenges we ran into
1. Programming first time on matic network.
2. Dynamic loading of Blockchain Data from matic testnet v3 into frontend(not sure why).
